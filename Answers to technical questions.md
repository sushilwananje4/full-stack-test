1. How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.

Ans: I have spent three days working on given assignment.
If I had more time to implement the assignment i would have do following things:
Make the slider images retrive from Database
Make Create CRUD operation on slider images
Make text overlay on middle column slider

2. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

Ans : I will check that the databases are optimised or not, readability of code,Load distribution, Default configuration of production.
And then I will come up with a perfect optimised settings for configurations, Optimise the datbases if they are not normalised and also optimising code complexity to render faster.
